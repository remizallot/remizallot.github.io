The Zallot Lab at Manchester Metropolitan University welcomes motivated and curious individuals to join our dynamic research team. We offer opportunities for self-funded Master’s by Research and PhD programs, and we welcome postdoctoral researchers aiming to secure external funding. Our research spans bioinformatics, biochemistry, microbiology, and education, with a focus on enhancing human health through a deeper understanding of microbial systems.

Why Join Us?
======
**Multidisciplinary Research**: Our lab integrates bioinformatics, biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology to tackle complex biological questions.<br />
**Collaborative Environment**: We foster a supportive and collaborative atmosphere, encouraging intellectual curiosity and skill development.<br />
**Impactful Work**: Our research has real-world applications, aiming to improve human health through a deeper understanding of microbial systems.

Opportunities
======
**Postdoctoral Positions**<br />
If you are an experienced researcher looking to advance your career in a collaborative and innovative environment, our lab provides an excellent platform for your professional growth. We offer the chance to mentor candidates applying for externally funded positions, such as the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA PF). I have personally benefited from this scheme, and I have a good understanding of what is looked for in an application. Other funding calls are available. Please do not hesitate: Reach out if you have an idea worth exploring.

**Self-Funded Master’s by Research and PhD Programs**<br />
We invite self-funded students to pursue a Master’s by Research or PhD in our lab. Our research focuses on characterising genes, enzymes, and transporters from bacterial pathogens. Have an idea for exploring an important biological process in ESKAPE pathogens? Let us know, and let's work together to develop an application. If you are eager to contribute to impactful research, we encourage you to contact us and then apply. 

**Undergraduate Final-Year and Master’s Projects**<br />
We offer various projects annually:<br />
**Microbiology**: Explore how bacteria utilise various molecules for growth, contributing to our understanding of microbial metabolism.<br />
**Biochemistry**: Work on recombinant enzyme characterisation, gaining hands-on experience in biochemical techniques.<br />
**Education**: Develop 3D-printed models of enzymes to enhance teaching and learning in biochemistry and cellular science.<br />
**Meta-analysis**: Conduct research related to the treatment of bacterial infections from ESKAPE pathogens.
